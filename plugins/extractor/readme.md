# Obsidian Cleaner

This plugin is like the core Note Composer plugin on steroids. It's capable to extracting _multiple_
different types of notes, each with their own template, directory, and naming scheme.

For each extraction you add, Extractor does the following.

1. Create a new note using the naming scheme you've set up.
2. Apply a template of your choice to the new note.
3. Copy the selected text to the new note.
4. Replace the selected text with a link.
5. Open the new note.
